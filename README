Building from Sources
---------------------

Check out the latest state from Git:

    git clone https://git.pengutronix.de/git/tools/dt-utils
    cd dt-utils

And then build using autotools:

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make

There's also experimental support for building with meson.
The intention is to deprecate autotools eventually in its favor. To build:

    meson setup build
    meson compile -C build
    meson test -C build  # optional
