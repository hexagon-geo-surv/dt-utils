Possibly breaking changes
-------------------------

(none known)

New features
------------

* commit f80d96b15978 "libdt: add support for barebox,storage-by-uuid" added
  support for specifying barebox-state backend nodes in the device tree using
  the 'barebox,storage-by-uuid' compatible. The similarly-named Barebox driver
  looks for a storage device matching the given UUID, and when found registers a
  new device for it. This makes it possible to use GPT and MBR partitions as
  state backends without re-stating their respective partition tables in the
  device tree.

* commit bfa8e8eab135 "state: automatically find state.dtb in the ESP"
  implemented auto-detection of device trees on the EFI System Partition in
  /boot or /efi (the usual ESP mount points on most Linux distributions).

* barebox-state can now auto-detect state partitions on GPT if they have the
  Partition Type GUID 4778ed65-bf42-45fa-9c5b-287a1dc4aab1, which corresponds to
  a feature merged in Barebox v2023.07.0 (see commits leading up to
  <https://git.pengutronix.de/cgit/barebox/commit/?id=776714d9570253c46635>).
  - commit 2bab30b7d653 "libdt: add of_property_write_strings support"
  - commit c4ea02e5fb6e "libdt: generalize of_find_device_by_uuid for scoped lookup of all UUIDs"
  - commit 7de908382bed "libdt: fix of_get_devicepath looking up sibling if device unavailable"
  - commit 03a6d0146f5a "state: backend: direct: open block device in read-only mode if possible"
  - commit 86233cfe9ba5 "libdt: factor out u64 sysattr parsing into helper"
  - commit c458361777ab "libdt: drop broken if-branch"
  - commit cff3f1c19d78 "libdt: factor out __of_cdev_find helper"
  - commit 7a71beff497e "libdt: use block device partition instead of parent if found"
  - commit 72970a627990 "state: align with barebox use of of_cdev_find"
  - commit 5059165acd2b "libdt: use of_find_device_by_uuid for partuuid lookup"
  - commit b32cb1c15c42 "state: allow lookup of barebox state partition by Type GUID"

* commit 0976c48731ef "state: add option to lock device node" implemented
  locking the device node directly via flock() in the barebox-state tool instead
  of writing a lock file to the /run directory. This helps on systems that don't
  have a world-writeable /run. Currently the behaviour is disabled by default
  and can be enabled by the ./configure --enable-lock-device option and the
  'lock-device' option in meson.

* Meson was added as a build system. The support is currently experimental, but
  the plan is to phase out autotools in the future, but for now the old way of
  building the project will stay in place. See the updated instruction in the
  README for how to build dt-utils and run the new unit tests.
  - commit bc6e5d24916f "Add meson as build system"
  - commit 4e7ad815b856 "meson: options: use defaults of type boolean for boolean options"
  - commit 6dc8b1a948cf "meson: set optimization level to -O2 by default"
  - commit fc97420e830c "Makefile: include meson files in the dist tarball"

* There is now an initial set of unit tests, see the README on how to run them.
  - commit e5c524875a91 "meson: add simple integration test"
  - commit be44af10aa91 "libdt: add CONFIG_TEST_LOOPBACK"
  - commit 69a223619e28 "test: add barebox-state loop block device tests"
  - commit 885bb2feac99 "test: add test case with non-existent /dev/file"

* All files now have machine-readable license and copyright information, and the
  project conforms to the REUSE specification (see <https://reuse.software/>).
  You can build a Software Bill of Materials in SPDX format by running the
  'reuse spdx' command.

dt-utils 2021.03.0
==================

This release includes contributions from Ahmad Fatoum, Andrey Smirnov, Enrico
Jorns, Jan Luebbe, Jan Remmet, Jookia, Juergen Borleis, Kim Christensen, Lucas
Stach, Roland Hieber, Sascha Hauer, Stefan Agner, Steffen Trumtrar, Ulrich
Ölmann, Uwe Kleine-König and Xogium. Thanks to all contributors!

Possibly breaking changes
-------------------------

* commit a6ca873a368d "Don't install a pkg-config file for libdt"
  libdt isn't supposed to be installed as a system library as nobody wants to care about things like
  a stable API. Also the generated .pc file was completely bogus as it added "-labc" to the linker
  instead of -ldt-utils.

* commit 2dbca4c3284b "state: keep backward compatibility"
  This changes barebox-state's default behaviour.
  Previous variants of the state variable set did not contain metadata. The read function in the
  'direct' storage backend honors this, but the write function doesn't, which makes an update of the
  state variable set impossible.
  This commit introduces the new compile time option '--enable-state-backward-compatibility' to
  ./configure, which is disabled by default. If this compile time option is enabled, barebox-state
  will keep the storage in a format that can be read by barebox <= v2016.08.0 when writing variables
  into a 'direct' storage backend, or fail if this requirement cannot be guaranteed.

* commit d1e4783c0051 "follow the Developer's Certificate of Origin",
  commit 886f13aa31a6 "Makefile: add ./DCO to the dist tarball"
  (see files README and DCO)

New features
------------

* libdt:
  - commit af85ab844b1d "libdt: support finding devices by partuuid",
    commit 9f3915824bc7 "libdt: support upper-case hexadecimals in value of partuuid property"
    This allows specifying partitions in devicetree that are actually not described in the
    devicetree to allow referencing them, e.g.:
        partitions {
                compatible = "fixed-partitions";
                #address-cells = <1>;
                #size-cells = <1>;
                state_part: state {
                        partuuid = "21367da7-c51f-499f-9aad-e1f366992365";
                };
        };
  - commit 4826dcbce749 "libdt: enumerate amba bus as well"
    Make barebox-state usable on STM32MP1, which probes the SD/MMC host controller over amba, not
    the platform bus as most other ARM systems.

* barebox-state:
  - add new options --quiet, --force, and --version
    . commit 52221e50b0df "barebox-state: complete cmdline options"
    . commit 15786485ab8b "barebox-state: add cmdline option "--version""
  - commit 74cd46affa37 "barebox-state: get devicetree from file"
    Adds an -i/--input argument to barebox-state to allow passing a devicetree as a file instead of
    using it from the system. This can be used for example on systems that do not use device trees
    (such as x86) but where we want to use a dtb blob for describing the state storage and format.
  - commit 0a75604bc61f "barebox-state: have the --set option to avoid writes if possible"
    Previously, barebox-state --set would always dirty the state when successful. Users seeking to
    conserve write cycles thus have to --get the variable in question first to check whether to
    write it. Make life of such users easier by having barebox-state support this out-of-the-box.

* dtblint:
  - commit 38d7af00e6cb "dtblint: check reset-gpio-active-high + reset-gpio for matching polarity"
  - commit 8498644efe82 "dtblint: add support for fsl,imx6dl-iomuxc"
  - commit a75ea34157c5 "dtblint: fsl,iomuxc: improve check for reserved bits"

Bug Fixes
---------

* barebox-state:
  - commit 99918b8f3ad2 "barebox-state: fix usage of multiple state instances"
    This makes concurrent calls to barebox-state with the following syntax possible:
    $ barebox-state --get blue.x &
    $ barebox-state --get yellow.y &
  - commit 634317cc9120 "state: backend_bucket_circular: fix double free()"
  - commit ef7355cccc3a "state: Fix lseek error check in state_backend_bucket_direct_read()"
  - commit d59af7f22ab4 "state: Fix lseek error check in state_backend_bucket_direct_write()"
  - commit f234f3ec9498 "state: Fix lseek error check in state_mtd_peb_read()"
  - commit b85142e1cbd4 "state: Fix lseek error check in state_mtd_peb_write()"
  - commit a1fe3159ca2a "state: check length"
  - commit b548f61a0460 "state: backend_bucket_circular: mark block as bad if mtd_peb_torture() failed"
  - commit fd48fe4efb40 "state: use /run to store lockfile"
    The old location /var/lock is considered legacy, and might no longer exist on all systems.

* dtblint:
  - commit 1ec150f6927f "dtblint-imx-pinmux: fix wrong table entry"
  - commit 218b148b284c "dtblint-imx-pinmux: fix another set of wrong table entries"
  - commit 186ff7702c66 "dtblint-imx-pinmux: fix swmux suggested values"

dt-utils 2019.01.0
==================
This release includes contributions from Andrey Smirnov, Antony Pavlov, Daniel Schultz, Enrico
Jorns, Ian Abbott, Juergen Borleis, Ladislav Michl, Lucas Stach, Michael Olbrich, Philipp Zabel,
Roland Hieber, Sam Ravnborg, Sascha Hauer, Ulrich Ölmann, and Uwe Kleine-König. Thanks to all
contributors!

Changes:
* libdt: fix leaks of memory returned by read_file() calls
* libdt: xzalloc: die on failure, like the similar-named kernel function
* libdt: add of_property_write_string() as a convenience function to set a property to a string
* libdt: add dev_set_name() as a convenience function to set a device's name
* state: harmonize our implementation with upstream barebox:
  - Fixes:
    . backend_bucket_circular: fix the case when write size is not a power of 2
    . backend_bucket_circular: fix length check when reading old state format
    . backend_bucket_circular: fix two memory leaks
    . backend_storage: don't refresh the storage needlessly
    . fix error return value when state_new_from_node() cannot resolve a phandle
    . fix use-after-free in state_backend_format_dtb_pack()
    . make finding the backend node more robust by using its reproducible name
    . remove checks for xzalloc() returning NULL, which cannot happen
    . do not complain about missing backend-storage-type, which is irrelevant for mtd devices
  - Potentially breaking changes:
    . make pointing to the backend using a phandle the only supported method
    . state nodes without an alias in the /aliases/ node now lead to an error. barebox already creates
      a missing alias in the fixupped device tree automatically since v2017.06.0.
    . refuse to set the read-only 'dirty' state variable
    . remove unused arguments from state_new_from_node()
  - New features:
    . add new 'init_from_defaults' state variable to allow detection whether a state has been
      initialized from default values, i.e. state_load() failed.
    . add an internal variable to protect existing data in a state bucket and make updates of the
      state implementation more robust
    . add new function state_read_mac() to read a MAC address from state
    . notify when the old state format is detected (this was previously a debugging message)
    . provide an error message when an error occurs in state_convert_node_variable()
    . add more debugging messages
  - port several changes to barebox's fixup functions, but since device trees are already fixupped at
    boot time, this code is never used by dt-utils
  - some further minor refactoring as well fixing some typos and documentation comments
